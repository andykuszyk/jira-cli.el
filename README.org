* jira-cli.el
** About
This package is a simple wrapper around the [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli][jira-cli]]. I have found myself often wanting to run Jira CLI commands, and then manipulate the output in an Emacs buffer; which is what this package makes easier.

I have also written a related package for creating and editing Jira issues using org-mode source blocks: [[https://github.com/andykuszyk/ob-jira-markdown.el][ob-jira-markdown.el]].
** Installation
This package is not yet on MELPA, but can be installed locally with:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package jira-cli
  :ensure t
  :load-path "/path/to/jira-cli.el/"
  :custom
  (jira-cli-host "https://your-org.atlassian.net")
  :bind (("C-x j j" . jira-cli)))
#+end_src
** Requirements
This package relies on [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli][jira-cli]] to communicate with Jira. You should ensure that you have [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][installed]] and [[https://github.com/ankitpokhrel/jira-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started][configured]] it, before attempting to use ~jira-cli~.
** Usage
Run ~M-x jira-cli~ to list issues assigned to you. This will open a Jira CLI buffer, which then has the following keybindings:

| Key   | Function                                                 |
|-------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~j~   | Run a JQL search                                         |
| ~a~   | List issues assigned to you                              |
| ~r~   | List issues reported by you                              |
| ~o~   | Open the issue at point in a web browser                 |
| ~w~   | Add the reference of the issue at point to the kill ring |
| ~e~   | View a list of epics for the current project             |
| ~RET~ | View the issue at point in plain-text                    |

This package mainly makes use of configuration for the Jira CLI itself, however if you want to temporarily override the project being used for commands, you can do so with ~M-x jira-cli-set-project~.
